# ~~PyGame Breakout~~ PyGame sample game

(cloned from https://gitlab.com/the-gigi/pygame-breakout and mutated)

This is a simple implementation with Python 3 and PyGame of the classic [Breakout](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakout_(video_game)) game. The purpose is to serve as a demo game for a
series of articles on building games with Python 3 and PyGame:

# Installation and usage

The prerequisites are:
- [Python 3.8](https://docs.python.org/3.8/) 
- [Pipenv](https://pipenv.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) 

Then clone the [repository](https://gitlab.com/the-gigi/pygame-breakout) and type:

```
pipenv install
```

You should see something like:

```
$ pipenv install

Alternatively, run a command inside the virtualenv with pipenv run.
```

To run the game type:

```
pipenv run python breakout.py
```
